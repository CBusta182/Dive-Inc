This is a basic, bare bone Idle Game to demonstrate the basic knowledge and skills I have with Unity 2D. 

Within this project, I am able to demostrate I can effectively create a simple game that has a basic UI and some functionalities. 
The player of the game is able to click on the screen to aquire shells which can then be sold to earn currency. 
The currency can then be used to buy divers, the secondary way to obtain shells. 
Each diver generated 1 shells every 8 seconds. 

The player can also buy upgrades with their obtained currency to increase the value of the shells, increase how many shells they can earn per click, how many shells they can hold at one time, and, the frequency in which their divers can obtain the shells . 

Please note that the coins per second feature is non functional as while I was developing the game, I decided to go down a different path and use this game as part of my Portfolio of basic games I have created.
